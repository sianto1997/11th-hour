Normality Assessment:

The Shapiro-Wilk test results show p-values of 0.967 (Before) and 0.918 (After), both well above 0.05, indicating we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality for either distribution
The Q-Q plots for both Before and After measurements show points falling fairly close to the diagonal line, supporting the normality assumption
The histograms with overlaid normal curves also suggest roughly normal distributions for both measurements

Correlation Analysis:

There is a very strong positive correlation between Before and After measurements (r â‰ˆ 0.991)
The extremely low p-value (2.32e-15) indicates this correlation is highly statistically significant
The scatter plot shows a clear linear relationship between Before and After measurements, with points closely following the regression line

Effect of Treatment:

The mean cholesterol level decreased from 6.408 mmol/L to 5.779 mmol/L
The range of values narrowed: Before (3.91-8.43 mmol/L) to After (3.66-7.67 mmol/L)
The consistent pattern in the scatter plot suggests the treatment had a fairly uniform effect across different initial cholesterol levels
